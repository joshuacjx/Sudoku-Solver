# Sudoku Solver
This is a simple Python script that is able to solve any partially-filled Sudoku input instantly.

## Usage Instructions
Clone this repository in your Desktop. Next, run `python gui.py` in your Command Line.

## GUI
The Graphic User Interface (GUI) is made using the Python Tkinter library.

Some suggestions for future extension include:
- Changing the colour for the input fields to black once the input has been changed
- Allowing the GUI to output all pairs of conflicting assignments instead of just one
- Colour-coding the different subgrids to make the GUI more visually intuituve.

## Backend
The Sudoku is solved using the Backtrack Search algorithm learnt in an Artifical Intelligence module in NUS.
